# A Data Visualization Article on Marriage Trends Across 3 Different Countries

## Introduction 

Getting married is often one of the most important decisions someone can make in their lives. The purpose of marriage can be vastly different depending on the culture, ranging from love to business to social connections.To this day, the role of marriage is constantly evolving all around the world. Generally, marriage rates are decreasing around the globe for a variety of reasons. For example, some reasons driving down marriage rates are people are getting married at an older age and the perceived value of marriage is decreasing. By taking a closer look at three unique countries, we can gain insights into why global marriages are on a downward trend despite the role of marriage varying so much across cultures. In the United States, demographic factors like race and income are highly correlated with marriage rates. In India, the average age when a person is married is increasing, particularly in states that are more progressive. In France, childbearing and marriage are becoming increasingly decoupled, as people are no longer finding marriage to be an important prerequisite to having a child. When put together, these three cases give us some perspective on how the global perception of marriage is shifting.
